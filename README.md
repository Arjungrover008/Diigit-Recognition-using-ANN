# Digit-Recognition-using-ANN

Recognition of hand written digits using MAchine learning. MNIST data set with 50000images for traiing and 20000 images for testing. 
the project was sucessfully able tp determine the digits with 91 % accuracy.
Multi Layered ANN used to deterimine the result.
Sigmoid activation function.


The goal of the project was to determine as many digits possisble with minimum error and maximum accuracy. Minor 1 College project with possible user applicability.
